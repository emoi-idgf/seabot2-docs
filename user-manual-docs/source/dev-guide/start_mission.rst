Starting a mission
==================

On your chosen location on your local computer create an xml file to define the mission.

Once defined, upload your mission file on the seabot using:

.. code-block:: bash

    zsh ~/seabot2/seabot2-tools/seabot2-scp/seabot2_mission_upload <path_to_your_mission_file> <seabot2_id>
